The decreased stress (due to decreased pain) and increased muscle relaxation may warrant the anesthetic risk.  The respiration must be monitored continuously, it will be labored if the bird is kept sufficiently light.  The head should be elevated to aid respiration.<br/><br/>* Barring adherence of the egg to the uterus, the administration of steady, unchanging digital pressure between the end of the sternum and the egg will cause the slow descent of the egg.  At this point, the uterus will often evert, which is not cause for alarm.<br/><br/>* Gradually the white pinhole where the uterine opening is located will be revealed.<br/><br/>* This opening will gradually dilate.  Very seldom will any additional pressure or manipulation be needed.  The entire procedure generally takes less than two minutes under isoflurane.<br/><br/>* ......<br/><br/>*After the egg is delivered, the uterus gradually involutes.<br/><br/>* A small amount of antibiotic ointment, with or without a glucocorticoid may be applied to the vent with a cotton-tipped applicator to aid in reducing swelling and decreasing straining.

Caution should be used that the quantity of glucocorticoid is minimal.<br/><br/>* If the egg is adhered to the uterine wall or if its size precludes passage,<br/><br/>* the egg may need to be deflated by either percutaneous or cloacal aspiration.<br/><br/>* A small incision into the wall of the uterus may aid in freeing up any adherent tissue.<br/><br/>* Complications can arise when attempting to relieve egg binding due to various predisposing physiologic or mechanical conditions in the hen.  These include: vent or cloacal abnormalities (such as the wart-like growths on the cloaca of this older lutino cockatiel female),<br/><br/>* ovarian neoplasia or cystic ovaries,<br/><br/>* egg-related peritonitis,<br/><br/>* and abnormally shaped or sized eggs.<br/><br/>* If the egg must be collapsed to allow passage or retrieval, the uterus should be flushed copiously to remove any remaining shell fragments or yolk contamination.","in":"./Clips/AvEggIn.mp4","intxt":"* Egg binding is a common problem in smaller bird species such as cockatiels, budgerigars and lovebirds.  As with dystocia in other species, it can be difficult to determine when to intervene.  If the hen has laid eggs previously, the owner can be a valuable source of information concerning the usual behavior of this bird during the laying period.<br/><br/>* Most birds look ill prior to laying an egg with clinical signs that may include lethargy, a fluffed appearance, and very large, watery droppings.  If the bird’s owner has no previous experience or history of egg laying in this bird, it is difficult to determine whether the bird is ill or showing normal pre-ovulatory behavior.  The safest approach is to have the owner present the bird to you for evaluation as soon as egg binding is suspected.","pw":"./Clips/AvEggPw.mp4","pwtxt":"* The presence of a hard, palpable structure in the pubic area is suggestive of an egg.<br/><br/>* Radiography may aid in confirming the presence of an egg.<br/><br/>* The ventriculus may be displaced caudally due to a space-occupying abdominal mass that is not related to the reproductive tract, such as hepatic enlargement.  This can cause the ventriculus to be palpable as a firm structure in the same sterno-pubic area in which an egg would be located.  Female reproductive masses, including cystic ovaries, ovarian or uterine neoplasia, or an egg that is still high in the coelomic cavity will often displace the ventriculus cranio-ventrally, as is illustrated in this radiograph.  An egg-bound bird that presents with rear end paresis or paralysis, emaciation, marked depression or labored respiration must be given a guarded prognosis.  The pressure that the egg places on the nerves to the legs also causes pressure on the kidneys and related circulation.  This can lead to endotoxemia and death.<br/><br/>* Supportive care should be provided before attempting extraction of the egg.  The bird should be hydrated with fluids,<br/><br/>* given injectable calcium, and provided a warm enclosure.","is":"./Clips/AvEggIs.mp4","istxt":"* Generally, little is needed in the way of instrumentation.

Oxytocin and the avian equivalent, arginine vasotocin, both cause uterine contractions.  Oxytocin is a less potent uterine stimulant in birds than it is in mammals.<br/><br/>The prostaglandins, f-2 alpha prostaglandin (Lutalyse® - dinoprost tromethamine) and prostaglandin E (Prostin® E2 suppository, dinoprostone), may also be administered to induce egg laying.  If the egg is adherent to the uterine wall or unable to descend (often due to soft tissue swelling or collection of urates and stool), the administration of any of these drugs could theoretically lead to uterine rupture.  However, for many years, experienced avian veterinarians have successfully administered these medications, especially oxytocin and the prostaglandins, which are available to the average practitioner.","po":"./Clips/AvEggPo.mp4","potxt":"* If any hemorrhage has occurred (and it often will as the uterus stretches), antibiotics are indicated to prevent cloacal or uterine infection.<br/><br/>* Postoperatively the hen will continue to be depressed and have some labored breathing for a period of minutes to hours.  Generally, by the next day, she will return to normal, barring any complications.  The bird should be palpated prior to release and the owner advised of the potential for a second egg.  The multiple factors that contribute to pet bird egg laying and subsequent egg binding should be discussed with the owner.  Please see the references and current literature for a thorough discussion of these factors.","rf":"./Clips/Rf.mp4","rftxt":"1. Joyner KL: Theriogenology.

The underlying crop can then be manipulated to find an adjacent non-vascular area.  The size, shape and location of the foreign body may also influence the point of incision through the crop.  Removal of the foreign body can be accomplished through an incision smaller than the actual size of the object (much like cystic calculi in small animals), due to the distensibility of the crop.<br/><br/>* With a crop fistula, the “incision” is already made.  The surgeon must debride the granulating edges.<br/><br/>* The skin and crop serosal surface must be divided by dissection in order to close these structures as two separate layers.  Generally, the edges of the fistula have thickened with granulation tissue and will need to be resected back to an area of more normal thickness.<br/><br/>* When the excessive granulation tissue has been removed and the serosa of the crop separated from the skin, closure for either a crop fistula or an ingluviotomy may proceed.<br/><br/>* Any potential contamination of surrounding tissue should be prevented by extensive flushing.<br/><br/>* Closure is accomplished in two layers.  The ingluvies can be closed with a continuous suture pattern of absorbable material, inverting the edges.<br/><br/>* Some practitioners prefer simple interrupted sutures.  A Cushings pattern may also be used.  Regardless of the method chosen, the outcome should be a complete seal of the crop to prevent leakage into the subcutaneous tissue, and a minimal decrease in the size of the crop lumen.  The size of the suture material will vary with the size of the patient.<br/><br/>* The skin is then closed as a separate layer with nonabsorbable suture.<br/><br/>* Sutures may be removed in 7-14 days, however;<br/><br/>* if an extensive scab has formed around the skin suture, incorporating the suture itself, and there is no tissue reaction or other irritation present, it may be advisable to leave the skin sutures in place for a longer period.  In some instances, allowing the sutures to remain until the scab and suture shed in one piece is advisable.  Disruption of the scab may compromise the underlying tissue and cause dehiscence.","in":"./Clips/AvIngIn.mp4","intxt":"* An ingluviotomy is performed in order to gain access to the mucosal surface and lumen of the crop, proventriculus or ventriculus.<br/><br/>* Removal of a foreign body, such as a feeding tube, is the most common indication for this procedure.<br/><br/>* In very young birds, retrieval through the oral cavity may be accomplished with simple manual manipulation or the use of hemostats.<br/><br/>* In larger or older birds, a rigid endoscope may be necessary to visualize and extract ingluvial foreign bodies.  The endoscope may be used either orally or through an ingluviotomy incision, depending on the accessibility of the foreign body.<br/><br/>* In this V/D radiograph of a 9 month old Umbrella Cockatoo, a radiolucent piece of soft hand feeding tubing may be seen in the ventriculus.  The foreign body was not visible on plain films.  The ingluviotomy site can be used as a point of entry for access to lower portions of the gastrointestinal tract that cannot be reached through the oral cavity.<br/><br/>* In addition to foreign body retrieval from the proventriculus and ventriculus, biopsies of these structures may also be obtained through an ingluviotomy incision.<br/><br/>* Damage to the crop is most often from thermal burns caused by improperly heated hand-feeding formula.  This presentation is generally seen in young, hand-feeding birds.  The severity of the burn and the patient’s reaction vary greatly.  Some birds become ill from the tissue damage and may develop an endotoxemia and die despite intensive supportive care.  Other birds are totally asymptomatic and are presented by their owners when either food or a hole is noticed in the area of the crop.  In these avian patients, the crop has already fistulated, creating a demarcation between healthy tissue and necrotic tissue.<br/><br/>* It is not in the bird’s best interest to perform surgery immediately after the burn has occurred.  Wait until the area has begun to granulate, providing a healthy tissue bed for surgical reconstruction, will decrease the quantity of tissue that must be resected.<br/><br/>Because closure of an ingluviotomy incision is similar to that of a crop fistula repair, these procedures will be discussed concurrently, with differences in technique noted.","pw":"./Clips/AvIngPw.mp4","pwtxt":"* Birds with an ingested foreign body (often a feeding tube) may be asymptomatic, or they may be clinically ill with anorexia, regurgitation, depression and secondary infection.  The severity of the clinical signs dictates whether one should perform routine diagnostic testing such as a complete blood count (CBC) and serum chemistries, or whether the time required to obtain these results would allow further debilitation of the patient.  The same constraints apply to the administration of supportive care such as parenteral fluids, antibiotics and gavage feeding.  If the bird is not markedly depressed or debilitated, it may be wise to remove the foreign body as soon as possible.<br/><br/>* Crop burns are never a surgical emergency!  If the crop burn is severe, causing infection, dehydration, or endotoxemia, surgery is definitely contraindicated until these life-threatening conditions are controlled.  If the patient is asymptomatic, and the crop burn is recent with no fistula present, it is advisable to delay surgical repair for several reasons.  First, the general health of the bird can be determined, and any necessary therapy for infection, dehydration or other support can be administered.<br/><br/>* Secondly, the damaged area of the crop will become well demarcated with time and the viable tissue margins will form a healthy granulation bed.  This gives the practitioner definite boundaries for the surgical repair and decreases the likelihood of dehiscence.<br/><br/>* Thirdly, the tissue deficit that needs to be bridged during surgical repair will decrease, often dramatically, as the tissue contracts during healing.<br/><br/>* The contraction of the damaged tissue stretches the adjacent viable tissue, leaving a significantly reduced area to be repaired.","is":"./Clips/AvIngIs.mp4","istxt":"* The surgical pack must include small, fine quality instruments for delicate dissection and ligation of minute vessels.  Sterile cotton-tipped swabs are helpful for hemostasis in tight places.  Fine gauge, absorbable suture (generally 3-0 to 7-0) can be used for the crop closure layer.  Skin sutures of a comparable size, nonabsorbable material are used for the second layer of closure.<br/><br/>* Stainless steel, ball-tipped, crop feeders are useful for exploring the crop via the oral cavity to assure proper surgical closure.","an":"./Clips/AvIngAn.mp4","antxt":"* The standard administration of isoflurane via mask or preferably with endotracheal intubation provides excellent anesthesia for this procedure.","pp":"./Clips/AvIngPp.mp4","pptxt":"* If the bird is still eating, food and water should be withheld for approximately six hours prior to surgery.  Because the rate of crop-emptying varies with many factors, the crop should be palpated prior to surgery to determine its contents.  Severely ill birds that have had an esophageal feeding tube in place should have this tube removed prior to anesthesia to prevent reflux of intestinal contents.  The patient is placed in dorsal recumbency with the cranial portion of the body elevated to aid respiration and to prevent aspiration.  The crop should be empty of ingesta.<br/><br/>* If an ingluviotomy is being performed for foreign body retrieval on a healthy crop, the left lateral aspect of the crop should be entered.  This area is dorsal and to the left of the most dependent portion of the crop.  This location has reduced pressure from crop contents and is not in the path of a crop-feeding instrument.<br/><br/>If the surgery is being performed in order to repair crop damage, an area sufficient to allow closure of the deficit should be surgically prepared.  Feathers are plucked from the surgical field.  If a crop fistula is being repaired, the exudate and other organic debris should be removed from the periphery of the fistula.","po":"./Clips/AvIngPo.mp4","potxt":"* Whether the crop was compromised by a thermal burn or by surgical incision, minimal crop distention is desired postoperatively.  If the bird is an adult and eating on its own, a return to its normal diet is appropriate.<br/><br/>With baby birds, a smaller volume should be given at each feeding, at least for the first few days.  For example, a baby bird that weighs 400 grams may have been receiving 10% of its body weight (40 ml) of hand-feeding formula 3 times per day prior to the crop burn.  The initial few feedings postoperatively should be only 10 to 20 ml (25 to 50% of the normal volume).  This would require an increase in frequency of hand feedings in order to compensate for the decreased quantity of formula at each feeding.  The volume can generally be increased back to normal (assuming the bird is not yet at weaning age) within 5 days.","rf":"./Clips/Rf.mp4","rftxt":"1.

Any bleeding vessels are sealed.  With some patients it may be easier to incise between the last two ribs, transecting these ribs at the costo-chondral junction and reflecting the vertebral portion of the ribs dorsally.  Further retractor bands may then be placed.  Digital manipulation of the surgical site can be used to dilate the laparotomy incision, allowing fiberoptic light to be directed into the incision and providing space for placement of instruments into the left abdominal air sac.  Maximum visualization is desirable to facilitate the procedure.<br/><br/>* Upon entering the abdominal air sac, the proventriculus is located on the medial ventral wall.  The surgeon must penetrate the common wall of the suspensory ligament of the proventriculus, the abdominal air sac and the peritoneal cavity dorsal to the proventriculus.  Freeing the proventriculus allows visualization of the ovary, kidney, uterus and other abdominal organs.<br/><br/>* The ureter and the small and large intestines must be properly identified prior to cutting the uterus.  The uterus is suspended from the thoracic and lumbar musculature near the aorta and vena cava.  The uterine ligament crosses over the anterior division of the kidney and can be picked up at the infundibulum where it fans out across the ovary.  There is an ovarian vessel in this ligament and several vessels in the dorsal attachments of the salpinx and the uterus.  The ventral attachments of the ligament create the accordion pleating of the organ and can be safely cut to allow unfolding, resulting in easier location of the more significant dorsal vessels.<br/><br/>* In some cases the uterus is very large and is best bisected with radiosurgical forceps to allow exteriorization of the uterus and uterine vessels.<br/><br/>* to facilitate radiocautery of vessels. The uterine bulk is reflected, exteriorized, or transected as needed in order to visualize vessels for radiosurgical cauterizing or vascular clipping.<br/><br/>* The vessels of the uterus are sealed and then cut with the radiosurgical forceps.  However, if the vessels appear large, a yellow number 10 Hemoclip® can be applied, and the vessel then may be transected.<br/><br/>* The surgeon manipulates the uterine suspensory ligament caudally until the junction of the uterus and the cloaca is visualized.  The ureter is in this vicinity and must be identified to avoid transection.  The urates can usually be seen transversing the ureter, and this aids in its identification.<br/><br/>* Vascular clips are applied at the cloacal and the uterine sides of the oviduct.  It is transected between these clips.<br/><br/>* As one removes the salpinx, the final dorsal/anterior vessels are located and sealed.  The two sections, anterior and posterior, are shown.<br/><br/>* It is a good idea to apply vascular clips to any visible ovarian vessels.  Any oozing can often be sealed using the radiosurgical bipolar forceps.  Vessels that continue to ooze despite the application of Hemoclips® or the use of electrocautery may be packed with oxidized regenerated cellulose (Surgicel®).<br/><br/>* The ribs and intercostal tissues are realigned.

Indications for this procedure include:<br/>* the alleviation of egg binding that is recurrent or non-responsive to medical treatment,<br/><br/>* the removal of an infected or neoplastic oviduct,<br/><br/>* the prevention of recurrent prolapsed oviduct,<br/><br/>* and the prevention of recurrent egg-related peritonitis with its potential fatal sequelae.<br/><br/>Cystic follicles or other ovarian disorders may create hormone-induced syndromes, including; chronic prolapsing cloaca and behavioral disorders such as aggression, feather picking, obsessive reproductive or nesting behavior, and cannibalism.<br/><br/>* This pathologic hormone secretion may also manifest clinically as hyperostosis, elevated cholesterol and hepatic lipidosis.<br/><br/>*New medical procedures, such as the use of human chorionic gonadotropin and Depo-Lupron®, may decrease the need for avian salpingohysterectomy.  With the advent of organic formulated diets, the selection of breeding stock for health and temperament, and behavioral modification, the frequency of salpingohysterectomy may also be decreased.<br/><br/>* In the hands of an experienced, well equipped avian surgeon, salpingohysterectomy carries little risk but is generally recommended only after medical therapy has failed.","pw":"./Clips/AvHysPw.mp4","pwtxt":"* Surgical candidates should receive a thorough physical examination including the procurement of a complete medical history.<br/><br/>* Malnutrition is at the root of many overt or subclinical medical problems of captive birds.  These manifestations of illness warrant further diagnostics prior to the consideration of salpingohysterectomy due to the likelihood of underlying disease that may prove fatal if surgery is attempted prior to treatment.  Some clinical signs of illness that would require further diagnostics and treatment prior to surgery include; chronic non-healing decubital ulcers on the feet or hocks of pet birds<br/><br/>* abnormally pigmented feathers, the lack of powder down and abnormal beak or nail growth<br/><br/>* polyuria and polydipsia or bile-stained urine or urates.<br/><br/>* There are multiple, often related conditions that may present with these physical examination findings, including hepatic lipidosis, improper body weight (obesity or emaciation) and in females, cystic ovaries, egg peritonitis and/or egg binding, which are often associated with obesity.<br/><br/>* Diagnostic tests on birds exhibiting these pathologic findings on physical examination often reveal accompanying abnormal CBC results, serum chemistry values, and an imbalance of intestinal flora.  The presence of any of these abnormal findings should again warrant further diagnostics and treatment prior to salpingohysterectomy.<br/><br/>*Fecal Gram stains may demonstrate a decrease in normal bacteria or the presence of abnormal bacteria or yeast.<br/><br/>* A general preoperative work-up should minimally include a Gram stain of feces or of a cloacal swab, a complete blood count and serum chemistries (including bile acids for hepatic function).<br/><br/>On smaller birds such as cockatiels, which make up the majority of the patients undergoing this procedure, it is wise to first draw only the small quantity of blood that is necessary for a complete blood count until both the hematocrit value and the integrity of the bird’s hemostatic function are known.<br/><br/>* Prior to venipuncture or prolonged handling, the bird should be visually checked for anemia by observation of the color of the choanal tissue.  Anemic birds are poor surgical candidates.  Some coagulopathies are vitamin K-responsive, so vitamin K is administered parenterally to patients with excessive bleeding or potential problems with hemostasis.<br/><br/>* The PCV should be within normal limits, which is generally 50% or greater in cockatiels.  Minimal hemorrhage or hematoma formation should occur after venipuncture.<br/><br/>* The bird should be observed for signs of stress during and after this procedure, noting any subsequent depression, dyspnea, fluffed feathers or weakness.  Additional blood for serum chemistries can then be drawn without unnecessary risk.<br/><br/>* Birds that are obese, dyspneic or exhibiting ascitic fluid should not be anesthetized.  These patients should be treated medically and surgery reconsidered when their condition is stable and the clinical signs have diminished.<br/><br/>* Depressed, weak and emaciated birds seldom survive surgery.<br/><br/>Removal of the ovary can be dangerous due to the potential for damage to the adrenal gland or local vasculature.  In addition, complete removal is difficult and remnants of ovarian tissue frequently regrow (this has been observed in Amazons, cockatoos, ducks and pigeons).  Therefore, a successful method for removing the ovary in birds has yet to be developed.  One author has tried laser, microsurgery, radiosurgery and the use of vascular clips with inconsistent results.<br/><br/>Salpingectomy (without removal of the ovaries) performed on cockatiels and budgerigars generally results in a temporary cessation of ovarian function and the associated disorders, with subsequent waning of clinical signs over the following months.  Conversely, in Amazons, ducks and larger cockatoos, preliminary data has indicated that these species may have continued ovarian-related disorders post-salpingectomy.<br/><br/>* Changing the diet to a formulated product along with medical management with human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) or Depro-Lupron may better prepare birds for surgery.  This therapy may even obviate the need for surgery indefinitely.  Holistic support with lactulose, vitamins and various herbs (including milk thistle) are often beneficial because concurrent hepatopathy is often present.  However, improvement with medical treatment often takes several months.<br/><br/>* In birds that require emergency intervention there are often complications including death.  The risks are so significant that an emergency salpingectomy is seldom warranted in a debilitated bird.  The exception may be acute uterine prolapse.  Assuming the absence of other pre-existing disease, the short-term prognosis for this condition is better than other emergency presentations.  A partial salpingohysterectomy can often be accomplished through the cloaca.  This less invasive procedure may suffice to allow medical treatment to improve the bird’s general condition.  Subsequent elective completion of the salpingohysterectomy may be considered later.<br/><br/>Possessing the necessary experience and equipment to safely perform a salpingectomy is vital.  Referral to an avian specialist with the capability to perform this procedure is an option.  With the modern air transport system available today this referral is more convenient than it has been in the past.<br/><br/>* Communication with the client is especially important.  A complete discussion of the operative procedures, risks, postoperative care and expectations are imperative to ensure client comprehension, and therefore satisfaction, with the quality of the treatment protocol.","is":"./Clips/AvHysIs.mp4","istxt":"* An ophthalmic surgical pack, containing Strabismus or iris scissors, ophthalmic dressing and tissue forceps, and micro mosquito forceps should be available.

A LoneStar veterinary retractor system, a mini-Balfour retractor, or one of several other small retractors may be utilized for maintaining patency of the celiotomy incision.<br/><br/>* Small diameter suture material should be utilized.  An optional internal layer of absorbable monofilament suture and a synthetic non-absorbable suture for external closure should be available.  Generally 4-0 to 10-0 suture is selected.

Constant spoiling, petting, feeding of foods that stimulate reproduction (nuts, seeds, bones) may cause the ovary to reactivate and the clinical signs to recur.

A large spleen should be positioned carefully when exteriorized to prevent compression of the splenic vessels. The engorgement also predisposes the spleen to tearing and subsequent hemorrhage.  The spleen and any associated bowel loops should be kept moist with a warm isotonic solution.<br/><br/>* If the affected adrenal gland has been identified by ultrasonography, the surgeon may be tempted not to explore both sides, but it is generally recommended to visually or palpably inspect both adrenals before electing to excise either one or both of these glands.<br/><br/>* Generally the left adrenal is explored first.  It lies craniomedial to the left kidney, often imbedded in a large amount of abdominal fat.<br/><br/>* The left adrenal is often palpable but not always visible initially because of the surrounding fat.

The spleen remains exteriorized as does much of the small intestine.<br/><br/>* The right adrenal gland lies cranial and medial to the right kidney and is often adherent to or adjacent to the caudal vena cava.<br/><br/>* Location of the right kidney, and subsequent location of the caudate liver lobe with its small ligamentous-appearing attachment to the kidney or caudal vena cava verifies that the surgeon is in the proper location.<br/><br/>* Attempting to palpate the right adrenal without severing this attachment is difficult and may led to tearing of the hepatic tissue or vena cava, so it may be preferable to sever this structure. <br/><br/>* The right adrenal gland will usually be found directly under the tip of this liver lobe, and directly adjacent to, or adherent to, the caudal vena cava.  The location of the right adrenal gland will vary between individual ferrets. It may be buried in fat, under the caudate liver lobe, under the vena cava or even to the left of the vena cava. It must be specifically located and identified before the surgeon decides which, if any, adrenal gland is abnormal and if one or both should be removed.<br/><br/>* Inexperienced surgeons often visualize the left adrenal while attempting to locate the right side,<br/><br/>* as it is readily visible through the thin midline fascia.<br/><br/>* This right adrenal is enlarged and darker red than normal.<br/><br/>* This enlarged right adrenal was located to the left of the vena cava.<br/><br/>* This abnormal right adrenal grew under the vena cava and could be seen from both sides.<br/><br/>* The left adrenal is re-located if the decision has been made to remove it.  It will usually be located 1 cm or more lateral to the vena cava, cranial and medial to the left kidney.<br/><br/>* It is carefully teased away from the surrounding fat.<br/><br/>* The adrenolumbar vein should be ligated, a Hemoclip® applied or cauterized.  A small amount of blood may seep into the surgical field.  The left adrenal is fairly easily dissected and removed.  Occasionally, diseased left adrenals will not have the clear, encapsulated appearance, and this may make it more difficult to determine that the entire structure has been removed.<br/><br/>* The right adrenal is resected next if it is abnormal.  It is re-located by finding the right kidney and the caudate liver lobe.<br/><br/>* The right adrenal is teased away from the caudal vena cava, being careful to avoid lacerating this large vessel.  Cotton tipped applicators or Weck sponges can work well for this.  Generally the surgeon will work from the lateral aspect or the side of the right adrenal NOT adherent to the vena cava.<br/><br/>* Exceptional care is needed to dissect the right adrenal because it is more intimately connected to the vena cava.<br/><br/>* Often, even when performed by experienced surgeons, portions of the right adrenal or its capsule may remain, being tightly adherent to the caudal vena cava.  Debulking (removal of a majority of the adrenal) is sometimes all that is possible, without risking serious damage to the vena cava.<br/><br/>* In other cases, opening the adrenal capsule and shelling out the contents, leaving the capsule adherent to the vena cava, is a useful approach.<br/><br/>* Each surgery will vary according to the size and position of the diseased right adrenal gland.<br/><br/>* If there is sufficient room to manipulate between the right adrenal and the vena cava, a ligature or a Hemoclip® may be applied between the two structures.  Whenever an attempt is made to totally resect the right adrenal, the possibility of laceration of the vena cava exists.<br/><br/>* The neonatal Satinsky’s vena cava clamp was first recommended by Avery Bennett DVM, ACVS to aid in the removal of the right adrenal gland when it is closely adherent to the vena cava.  This clamp may be used to partially or totally occlude the caudal vena cava while the right adrenal is resected.  If the vena cava has been infiltrated with diseased adrenal tissue this clamp allows resection of the adrenal and vascular repair of the vena cava with minimal danger of hemorrhage.  The neonatal DeBakey clamp is also recommended.<br/><br/>* If the vena cava is accidentally nicked, application of a hemostatic material such as Surgicel® is often sufficient, and the ferret can be closed with the material in place.  Affected vessels should be observed for several minutes before closing.  A small laceration in the vena cava may be closed with small size (5-0 or smaller) absorbable suture material.<br/><br/>* It has been reported that surgeons have actually been forced to ligate the entire vena cava because of severe lacerations and that these ferrets have survived.  Obviously, this is not the method of choice.  Adrenal tissue that has been removed is submitted for histopathology.<br/><br/>* The incidence of insulinomas of the pancreas is nearly as high as that of adrenal tumors, and these tend to occur at about the same age.  Therefore, the pancreas should be examined during the adrenalectomy surgery.  The surgical incision for an adrenalectomy allows a complete view of the pancreas.  For more information on insulinomas, see the section describing this surgical technique.<br/><br/>Mesenteric lymph nodes should also be examined and biopsied or resected if they are enlarged or abnormal.  Lymphoma is also common in ferrets of this age group.<br/><br/>Ovarian remnants or ectopic adrenal tissue may be identified during the procedure.  Ovarian remnants in a female may appear in the same fatty area as the adrenal gland.  Histologically, pathologists cannot always distinguish between ovarian remnants and adrenal neoplasia.  Both must be resected if possible.<br/><br/>Occasionally adrenal or ovarian tissue will be adherent to the bladder; that area should also be visually explored.<br/><br/>* Prostatic cysts, when present, usually resolve within three to five days post adrenal surgery.<br/><br/>* Closure is routine.<br/><br/>* Absorbable suture of the surgeons choice is used through the linea, in either a continuous or simple interrupted pattern.<br/><br/>* The linea closure is followed by subcutaneous absorbable sutures and subcuticular or nonabsorbable skin sutures.<br/><br/>* Nonabsorbable skin sutures are probably warranted when the patient is very active or pruritic, though in our experience, adult ferrets do not usually bother their suture line or have incision problems.<br/><br/>* Often subcuticular sutures or tissue glue is adequate.<br/><br/>* This resected adrenal gland was two to three times normal size.","in":"./Clips/FeAdIn.mp4","intxt":"* Adrenal tumors (most commonly adenoma or adenocarcinoma) and adrenal hyperplasia are seen in 50 to 80% of ferrets over the age of three in the United States.<br/><br/>* The most common diagnostic indicator is progressive, symmetrical alopecia beginning over the hips and tail.<br/><br/>* Spayed females will often develop an enlarged vulva and neutered males may exhibit sexual behavior or dysuria most likely due to cystic prostatic tissue.<br/><br/>* Alopecia may begin as hair loss of the tail (also called rat tail) and may be cyclical, with regrowth of some or most of the hair during the first few episodes.<br/><br/>* Generally, the degree of hair loss is progressive,<br/><br/>* and without treatment will often lead to nearly total alopecia.<br/><br/>* Pruritus may accompany this hair loss.  The degree of pruritus is extremely variable, from just an occasional scratching episode to acute self-mutilation and subsequent skin lesions resembling atopy in dogs.<br/><br/>* Female ferrets may exhibit swelling of the vulva from excessive hormone production by the affected adrenal gland(s).  Occasionally, if left untreated elevated estradiol levels may lead to bone marrow suppression as it would in the intact female ferret in prolonged estrous.  Therefore, vulvar swelling is one indication to proceed more aggressively with adrenal disease diagnosis and treatment.<br/><br/>* Prostatic cysts are common in male ferrets with adrenal disease.  Caudal abdominal swelling can be due to a prostatic cyst-like structure that may have a direct connection to the bladder or urethra.  The dysuria that may be associated with this cystic swelling is another reason to aggressively proceed with the treatment of adrenal disease.  Although the adrenal disease is the likely primary cause of the prostatic cystic formation, secondary bacterial infections are common and should be addressed.  Research involving hormonal manipulation and other medical therapy to decrease the prostatic size is ongoing.<br/><br/>* Adrenal disease may affect one or both adrenal glands.  Early literature reported that in 90% of the cases, only the left adrenal gland was involved.  As the ability of surgeons to locate the right adrenal gland improved, the statistics have changed and right-sided tumors are recognized much more frequently.  Many authors still believe that the left side predominates, although both bilateral and right-sided unilateral adrenal tumors commonly occur.<br/><br/>* An androgen panel is commercially available that measures three different androgen levels (see references for available lab).  The androgen panel has proven accurate in its correlation with adrenal disease and may be useful in cases when the clinical signs are not overwhelmingly convincing and as an additional diagnostic tool prior to surgery.  The adrenals of ferrets secrete primarily androgens (estrogen, testosterone and progesterone precursors) rather than glucocorticoids; therefore, the usual screening tests for dogs and cats, including the urine cortisol levels, are not appropriate for diagnosing adrenal tumors in ferrets.","pw":"./Clips/FeAdPw.mp4","pwtxt":"* Adrenal tumors are usually not immediately life-threatening; therefore, surgical candidates should be bright, alert and eating well.  An adrenalectomy should not be performed if more serious untreated metabolic problems exist concurrently.<br/><br/>* A complete blood count and serum chemistry panel (including blood glucose after a three to four hour fast) should be performed to ensure adequate general health and to rule out concurrent illness.  Renal disease, hepatopathy, insulinoma and lymphoma are common in older ferrets and may be detected on these preoperative tests.<br/><br/>* Ultrasound in experienced hands may also be used to identify enlargement of one or both adrenal glands.<br/><br/>* Cardiomyopathy is common in the same age group as adrenal neoplasia and should be ruled out prior to anesthesia.  If there is concern with cardiac function, thoracic radiographs, ECG, occult heartworm test and cardiac ultrasound may be indicated.  This lateral radiograph demonstrates generalized cardiomegaly.<br/><br/>* It is important to remember that ferrets with concurrent insulinomas require careful consideration prior to undertaking an adrenalectomy.  Insulinomas lower the blood glucose, as does the removal of glucocorticoid-producing adrenal tissue.  The potential for severe hypoglycemia exists when adrenal glands are removed and concurrent insulinomas are undiagnosed.  The pancreas should always be examined and any visible insulinomas should be removed at the time of the adrenalectomy.<br/><br/>* If the medical condition of the ferret or financial constraints of the owner do not allow surgery, oral Lysodren® (o.p.ddd) may be considered.  Lysodren® is not as effective in ferrets as it is in dogs.<br/><br/>Ketoconazole does not work in ferrets as it does in dogs.  Metyrapone® and l-deprenyl work in dogs with Cushing’s disease at the pituitary level, so they would also not be effective in ferrets with adrenal disease.","is":"./Clips/FeAdIs.mp4","istxt":"* A small surgical pack is needed with a sufficient number of small, fine-quality instruments for delicate dissection and ligation of small vessels.  Sterile cotton-tipped swabs are helpful for hemostasis.<br/><br/>* In experienced hands, the use of a radiosurgery unit may be warranted.  The potential for bleeding from either the caudal vena cava, or the vessel supplying the adrenal gland from the vena cava, exists.<br/><br/>* Several options for controlling this hemorrhage should be available, including small ligatures for vascular repair,<br/><br/>* Hemoclips®, and an absorbable hemostatic material, such as Surgicel® or Gelfoam®.<br/><br/>* Hemoclips® are used routinely by some surgeons.<br/><br/>* The neonatal DeBakey vena cava clamp with a double angle can be very useful in removing right adrenal glands adherent to the vena cava.","an":"./Clips/FeAdAn.mp4","antxt":"* Pre-surgical fasting is generally recommended for ferrets.  Because their gastrointestinal transit time is reported to be 4 to 6 hours and their propensity for hypoglycemia is high, a four to six hour fast is sufficient for non-gastrointestinal surgery.  Fasting a ferret for longer than this may result in hypoglycemia.<br/><br/>* If a concurrent insulinoma exists, the fasting time may be decreased to two to four hours, and an IV drip of 2.5% dextrose with a balanced electrolyte solution is indicated.<br/><br/>* Ferrets are excellent surgical candidates and tend to do well with most anesthetic protocols;<br/><br/>* however, isoflurane gas is the anesthetic of choice.<br/><br/>* Preanesthetic combinations including acetylpromazine at 0.1 to 0.25 mg/kg IM or SC, butorphanol at 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg, and atropine at 0.05mg/kg IM or SC are commonly employed.  The use of acetylpromazine may lead to further engorgement of the spleen, which is already enlarged in many of these patients.<br/><br/>* Gas induction via face mask or induction chamber is recommended<br/><br/>* followed by intubation and the use of a non-rebreathing system.<br/><br/>* Ferrets are intubated with a 2.0 to 4.0 mm endotracheal tube.

Even when they are malignant adrenal adenocarcinomas, they do not often metastasize to other organs, although metastasis to the liver is occasionally reported.  Therefore, the postsurgical prognosis is considered good when removal is complete.<br/><br/>* Ferrets often are not adversely affected by removal of both adrenal glands.  Apparently remaining adrenal activity may be sufficient, whether from adrenal remnants, ectopic tissue or expendable function.  However, a prednisolone derivative is generally administered post operatively for several days to weeks at 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg when a bilateral adrenalectomy has been performed.  It does not appear to impair healing and does replace the small amount of glucocorticoid that may have been secreted by the abnormal gland.  Thus, the ferret returns to normal appetite and activity more quickly.  Florinef is occasionally needed following bilateral adrenalectomy.  Antibiotics are administered prophylactically if there is concern with contamination of the surgical field, concurrent infection or immune suppression.<br/><br/>If higher doses of prednisone are needed to return the ferret to normal appetite and attitude, this warrants the use of prophylactic antibiotics.<br/><br/>* The client should be prepared for occasional extensive abdominal bruising, which is common in ferrets even when the procedure was performed with gentle manipulation.  The cause of this severe bruising is not known and the resolution is extremely rapid, generally taking three to five days.<br/><br/>* Resolution of the hair loss may take 45 days or longer.<br/><br/>* Around 30 days post surgery, the client may become concerned that areas of alopecic skin are turning bluish-black.  This is the result of new hair being produced by follicles just below the cutis.  Within three to four days the hairs will be ready to break through the skin.  Occasionally, a ferret will have been alopecic for so long that total regrowth will not occur.  Because ferret hair growth is seasonal during certain times of the year the re-growth may take longer to appear.<br/><br/>* The vulvar swelling in female ferrets will generally resolve within seven to fourteen days post-operatively.","rf":"./Clips/Rf.mp4","rftxt":"1.

Insulinomas are one of the most common tumors found in middle-aged to older ferrets in the United States.  Clinical signs may include intermittent lethargy, mental dullness, irritability, hypersalivation, pawing at the mouth, weight loss, weakness in the hind limbs, and in severe cases, seizures, coma or death.  These signs may occur acutely or have a gradual onset with increasing severity over several weeks to months.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Blood glucose measurements of less than 70 mg/dL suggest insulinoma.  Normal blood glucose values for ferrets range from 90 to 120 mg/dL.  Ferrets with insulinoma often have blood glucose levels that fluctuate.  Drawing blood after a four to six hour fast or using serial blood glucose measurements will be more accurate diagnostically.  Fasting is contraindicated if clinical signs of hypoglycemia are apparent.<br/><br/>Blood insulin levels may also help in making a presumptive diagnosis.  Ferrets with insulinomas are reported to have insulin values from 107.7 to 1738 µU/mL.  Normal values are reported to be 15 to 35 µU/mL.  Abnormally high insulin concentrations in association with low blood glucose levels are indicative of insulinoma.  A normal insulin concentration with an abnormally low blood glucose does not rule out insulinoma.  Exploratory laparotomy is the definitive diagnostic approach.<br/><br/>* Micro-metastasis throughout the pancreas has usually occurred by the time a diagnosis is made.  The incidental finding of insulinomas during gastric foreign body removal in ferrets less than two years of age indicates that these neoplasias may be present for prolonged periods prior to the onset of clinical disease.  Surgery is rarely curative but functions to debulk the visible tumor tissue in an attempt to slow the progression of the disease.  Medical treatment will be required at some future point as the disease progresses.  The owner should be forewarned that management of this disease will be required for the rest of the patient’s life.<br/><br/>* Medical treatment is aimed at maintaining a blood sugar level that provides for the ferret’s comfortable existence.  Prednisone at 0.10 to 0.50 mg/kg orally every 12 hours will serve to increase the blood sugar via several physiologic mechanisms.  Ferrets on prednisone therapy often do better clinically than their blood glucose levels would suggest, probably also due to the multiple effects of glucocorticoid administration.  As the disease progresses, the dose is increased as needed, often to levels as high as 2.0 mg/kg to approximate euglycemia.<br/><br/>* When prednisone alone fails to control the hypoglycemia, diazoxide at 5 to 30 mg/kg orally twice a day can be added to the treatment protocol.  The recommended diet is a high quality ferret food ad lib.  Sugary snacks should be avoided, as they tend to cause a rebound increase in insulin.

Research involving hormonal manipulation and other medications to decrease the prostatic size is ongoing.<br/><br/>* The urethrostomy site is located between the pelvic urethra and the os penis.<br/><br/>* A urinary catheter is placed when possible to allow easy location of the urethra.  This can be accomplished via the tip of the urethra or through the bladder if an exploratory and cystotomy are necessary.  The catheter in the urethra is palpated and an initial 1 cm longitudinal skin incision is made.<br/><br/>* The incision through the urethra is made using the catheter as a guide, and a suture is placed through the skin and the urethral mucosa.  This incision is continued to create a urethral opening at least 1 cm long.  Nonabsorbable 5-0 or 6-0 monofilament suture material is used in an interrupted pattern to attach the urethral mucosa to the perineal skin.  The patency is checked by expressing the bladder.<br/><br/>* Standard postoperative care is recommended.<br/><br/>* Sutures are removed in 2 weeks.  Despite the small diameter of the ferret urethra, stricture formation is not a common problem."}},"chelonia":{"shell repair":{"pr":"./Clips/TrSrPr.mp4","prtxt":"* Loose fractures may be wired in place through holes drilled in the shell.<br/><br/>* Some pieces can be held in apposition with the bonding agent.<br/><br/>* The area around the defect is gently abraded with sandpaper to allow the epoxy to bond well.<br/><br/>* Acetone is used to clean the borders of the injury, taking care not to get any of the substance into the wound.<br/><br/>* Pieces of sterilized fiberglass mesh that are 2 to 3 cm greater in diameter than the area to be covered are prepared.  The edges are cut in a curved line to prevent unraveling of the material.<br/><br/>* The epoxy is mixed as directed.  The amount mixed depends on the size of the defect.  The epoxy is allowed to set up for a few minutes until the consistency is approximately that of pudding.<br/><br/>* A thin coat of epoxy is applied around the defect extending about 2 cm out from the injury and taking care not to get epoxy into the wound.<br/><br/>* The fiberglass mesh is placed over the defect<br/><br/>* and the cloth is imbedded into the epoxy.  If necessary, the shell fragments may need to be held in apposition while the epoxy hardens.<br/><br/>* A second batch of epoxy is mixed and lightly applied to cover the entire piece of fiberglass mesh.  Large defects without enough healthy bone to close the gap can still be bridged with a roof of epoxy-impregnated fiberglass.  In these cases recovery can occur although bone-to-bone healing may not.  When an autograft is to be used, the epoxy and fiberglass mesh are applied to the graft first and allowed to dry.  Then this piece is positioned in place with a second application of epoxy.<br/><br/>* If the consistency of the epoxy is too thin or if too much volume has been used, bone healing may be impeded because the epoxy may spread into the wound.  If the epoxy is too thick, the fiberglass mesh will appear opaque instead of translucent.<br/><br/>* One to three layers of fiberglass mesh and epoxy may be needed depending on the size of the repair and the strength desired.  Fiberglass patches are buoyant.  When working with aquatic turtles, the patch should be as small and thin as possible to avoid interfering with the turtles ability to swim.  The patch should be dry to the touch in 5 to15 minutes and hard within 24 hours.  If the plastron was affected, a coating of aerosol vegetable oil will help prevent newspaper from sticking to the patch before it is completely dry.<br/><br/>* In aquatic turtles, a coat of marine resin should be applied over the epoxy 1 to 2 days after the initial repair.  This material may be obtained from marine supply stores.  It is slower to dry but is more durable in water than the quick drying epoxy.<br/><br/>* Prior to applying the marine resin, the epoxy coat should be lightly sanded and cleaned with acetone to improve the bond.<br/><br/>* A thin coat of marine resin is applied over the original epoxy patch and may require 24 hours or more to dry.<br/><br/>* In cases where the plastron has been damaged, support the turtle in dorsal recumbency in a cushioned shallow box.  Gauze and part of a syringe plunger are used to elevate the distal edge of the plastron, forcing the fractured pieces into alignment.<br/><br/>* The wound is cleaned and flushed.  The edges of the fracture are abraded with sandpaper and cleaned with acetone, taking care not to get dust or acetone into the fracture site.<br/><br/>* The fiberglass mesh is cut to fit the area.<br/><br/>* Epoxy is applied to surround the fracture without allowing any epoxy to touch the edges of the fracture itself.<br/><br/>* The fiberglass mesh is imbedded into the epoxy.<br/><br/>* A final light layer of epoxy is applied to penetrate through the mesh.  After drying for 5 to 10 minutes a coat of aerosol vegetable oil is applied to the patch before the turtle is placed upright.<br/><br/>* Full drying may require 1 to 2 days.<br/><br/>* As recommended previously for all aquatic turtles, marine resin is applied after abrading the patch with sandpaper and cleaning with acetone.<br/><br/>* In this case, clear silicone aquarium sealer is used to fill the small gap between the fiberglass patch and the skin.","in":"./Clips/TrSrIn.mp4","intxt":"* Turtle shell fractures are common in exotic practice and occur in both free-ranging and pet chelonians.

The patient is assessed for signs of hemorrhage, shock, pulmonary contusions, paresis and head trauma that may affect recovery.  Radiographs, including dorsoventral, horizontal beam anterioposterior and horizontal beam lateral, may be helpful in evaluating the extent of the injuries.  Injuries to the carapace midline may affect the underlying vertebrae incorporated in the ventral carapace.  Resulting spinal cord injuries may cause paresis or paralysis of the hind limbs.  An open coelomic cavity will pre-dispose the turtle to severe dehydration, systemic infection and respiratory compromise during wound flushing or submersion in water.<br/><br/>*  A complete blood count, serum profile and parasite check are recommended.<br/><br/>* Injuries that are less than a few hours old are contaminated but not yet infected and may be flushed with sterile saline, cleaned, debrided and repaired immediately if the patient is in a stable condition.<br/><br/>* Wounds more than a few hours old will be infected.  Topical and parenteral antibiotics will be necessary.

These wounds must be flushed copiously with sterile saline and any foreign material cleaned from the wound.  Topical antibiotics such as silver sulfadiazine or neomycin ointment are applied to the wound, avoiding contamination of the coelomic cavity, and a wet-to-dry bandage should cover the wound.  This bandage must be frequently changed until a healthy bed of granulation tissue appears, which may take weeks.  During this time it is important to maintain proper hydration and caloric intake.

If the damage is minor and the patient is cooperative the procedure can be done by taping the turtle on a thick support that is smaller than the base of the turtle (for example, an upside down bowl or a box).  This will keep the feet off the table and the turtle stationary.<br/><br/>* Turtles with plastron injuries can be placed in dorsal recumbency in a shallow bowl or box cushioned with a towel  This often eliminates the need for restraint.  Note that the respiratory capacity is diminished when in dorsal recumbency and respiration should be closely monitored.  The chelonian shell has many nerve endings and is sensitive to pain.  Therefore, moderate and severe injuries require anesthesia or sedation to provide analgesia during the procedure as well as immobilization of the patient.<br/><br/>Many choices now exist for reptile anesthesia.  The comfort level of the practitioner with a given drug in a particular species should dictate the selection.  The temperature of the turtles enclosure should be maintained in the preferred optimal range of 80 to 85°F (26.6 to 29.5°C) prior to the administration of anesthesia or sedation.  Maintaining the turtle at this temperature throughout surgery and recovery will facilitate consistent metabolism of the sedative or anesthetic.  Propofol at 5 to 10 mg/kg IV is useful if venous access is available.  Telazol® at 2-5 mg/kg IM, is used successfully, but the safety margin is narrow.  Ketamine alone at 20 to 50 mg/kg IM, although providing no significant analgesia, will immobilize the turtle for a sufficient period to perform this brief procedure.  Unlike mammals, reptiles tend to breathe more rapidly when dosed lightly with ketamine, because it inhibits their breath-holding response to the taste of inhalant anesthetics.  This may reduce the quantity of isoflurane needed if inhalant anesthesia is added to the protocol.  Inhalation anesthesia may be used following or in lieu of sedation.  If ketamine alone is used, a dose of 20 to 40 mg/kg IM will generally be sufficient.","pp":"./Clips/TrSrPp.mp4","pptxt":"* Once the patient is chemically or physically restrained, the wound must be cleaned and debrided.  Gloves should be worn while working with chelonians and other reptiles.  The surrounding area also needs to be cleaned and gently scrubbed free of algae and debris.  Surfaces must be dried well to allow adhesion of epoxy.  Any wounds more than a few hours old must be treated for infection as described above to avoid abscess formation under the repair work.  Pieces of shell that are devascularized should be removed.  Any large pieces should be saved in case they are needed later for autologous bone/shell grafts.","po":"./Clips/TrSrPo.mp4","potxt":"* Healing of the shell takes 1 to 2 years.  Chelonians should not be allowed to hibernate until the shell is healed.  If the turtle is a pet, you will be able to assess the healing radiographically.  If hibernation is allowed the turtle should be soaked occasionally and it’s weight and progress monitored.  In rapidly growing chelonians it may be necessary to remove parts of the fiberglass patch along the interfaces between the bony plates to allow unimpeded growth.  This may be done as early as 6 months after the repair.  Using a hand-held electric rotary burr, the fiberglass is removed along the margins of the growing scutes.  The dust is irritating (and possibly carcinogenic) to humans; therefore, protective eye wear and a face mask should be used.  As the sections become loosened over time they may be gently pried off with dental instruments.<br/><br/>* The patch may be left indefinitely on adult chelonians and those with defects that are too large to fill.  If the turtle is a free-ranging animal, you will probably not see it after release.  A business card may be placed under the final epoxy layer in case they are reinjured or otherwise recaptured.

Various factors are believed to contribute to this disease.  Exposure to suboptimal temperatures that occurs during winter, or indoor housing with poor husbandry, can suppress the animals immune system.  Many of these box turtles are deficient in vitamin A and, as a result, have developed squamous metaplasia of the mucosa in the mouth, pharynx, and eustachian tubes.  When the hygiene is also less than adequate, exposure to excessive bacteria can allow colonization of these areas with bacterial pathogens.<br/><br/>* Squamous metaplasia damages the normal mucosal surface so it is unable to expel the bacteria; the desquamated cells add to the caseated debris that can obstruct the eustachian tubes.  Some affected box turtles will present clinically normal, with a good appetite, weight and activity.  Others may be septic and quite ill with this syndrome.","pw":"./Clips/BTAAPw.mp4","pwtxt":"* A good physical examination will indicate the turtles general health.

It is common with aural abscesses to see exudate emptying from the eustachian tubes into the oral cavity in response to digital pressure applied to the external ear.<br/><br/>* If there is concern about the turtles general health, blood may be drawn from the jugular vein for a CBC and serum chemistry tests.  Although the diagnosis seems obvious,underlying conditions of poor hygiene, bacterial overload, parasitism, vitamin A deficiency, or suboptimal temperatures may contribute to additional clinical conditions, such as septicemia, anemia, anorexia, dehydration and subsequent renal impairment.<br/><br/>* In most cases, surgical debridement can be performed immediately but some turtles require supportive care prior to surgical intervention.<br/><br/>* Antibiotic therapy may be necessary to treat existing septicemia prior to surgery.

Regardless of the method chosen, tube feeding should be discontinued 24 to 48 hours prior to sedation or anesthesia.<br/><br/>* Due to the anatomy of chelonians, intravenous and intraosseous fluids are not easily administered.  Intracoelomic or subcutaneous fluids may be used.  Routes of subcutaneous fluid administration include utilizing the skin between the hind leg and the tail and the loose skin of the shoulder area.

This is the area where the testicle is generally the most accessible to palpation.<br/><br/>* It may be necessary for an assistant to extrude the testicle by externally placing caudal pressure on the cranial aspect of the testicle, forcing it into the scrotal sac.<br/><br/>* Locating the testicles may be more difficult in guinea pigs that are young or obese.<br/><br/>* The testes are smaller than they appear externally due to the surrounding fat.  After the incision is made through the skin and the underlying fascia, considerable lobulated fat may exteriorize while the area is being explored.  When the testicle is isolated, the ligament of the testes can be gently torn from the tunic, and the spermatic cord and vas deferens may be ligated with absorbable suture in a routine fashion.  If there is any doubt as to the identity of the structure, a partial open castration should be performed.  A “nick” can be made in the tunic, allowing the visualization of the classic testicular tissue.<br/><br/>A salient point should be made as to the practical reality of orchiectomy on many of these exotic species with open inguinal rings.  Although ideally the castration should be closed, leaving the tunic intact to prevent herniation, it is extremely common even for experienced surgeons to nick the tunic as they are incising over the scrotum.  The castration can still be “closed” because the tunic is still accessible, surrounding the spermatic cord and vas deferens.  Ligation of the tunic at this slightly more proximal location will still serve to provide a barrier to herniation.  Seldom is an extensive incision and closure of the inguinal ring necessary.<br/><br/>*  Double-clamping of the spermatic cord proximal to the testes and epididymis is advisable.  A double ligature should also be utilized when a closed castration with the intervening tunic tissue is performed, due to the decreased contact of the ligatures with the vessels.  If a full open castration is performed, it will require more surgical care to prevent postoperative herniation.  The inguinal fat can be returned to the inguinal ring to act as a barrier between the abdomen and the external inguinal canal.<br/><br/>* The spermatic cord is severed between the hemostats.<br/><br/>* The remaining tunic is carefully replaced into the abdominal cavity and checked for the presence of bleeding.<br/><br/>* A series of several simple, interrupted, absorbable sutures or a short continuous suture is then utilized to appose the overlying fascia.<br/><br/>* A short subcuticular pattern can be used to close the incision.<br/><br/>* The use of a well placed subcuticular pattern eliminates the presence of foreign material such as skin sutures, staples or tissue glue, and is generally well tolerated by guinea pigs as well as other rodents.<br/><br/>* The procedure is then repeated on the opposite side.<br/><br/>* The completed castration shows little evidence of the incisions because the scrotal skin is very elastic, and the small, subcuticular sutures tend to be hidden in the scrotal tissue.","in":"./Clips/GPOrIn.mp4","intxt":"* Castration may be performed on guinea pigs to prevent reproduction and any related objectionable behavior.

Once the vein is located, the incision can be extended as far as necessary to allow access to the reproductive organs.  If the ventral abdominal vein is damaged, ligation should be used to control hemorrhage.<br/><br/>* Care should be taken to avoid damaging the bladder, which is often located just beneath the incision.  Post-ovulatory egg binding necessitates removal of both the ovaries and the oviducts that empty directly into the cloaca.  Iguanas have no true uterus.  If the ovaries are not removed, they can remain active, thereby releasing yolks into the coelomic cavity.<br/><br/>* Once inside the coelomic cavity, the surgeon can evaluate the reproductive tract and the position of the eggs.<br/><br/>* Post-ovulatory egg binding will reveal multiple, whitish-colored eggs in the oviducts.<br/><br/>* One oviduct is exteriorized and ligated at the junction with the cloaca before transecting between the two ligatures.<br/><br/>* Vascular clips or sutures are used to ligate the large vessels supplying the oviduct, working from the cloaca to the infundibulum.<br/><br/>* The infundibulum is ligated and transected.<br/><br/>* The opposite oviduct is exteriorized and ligated at the point where it joins the cloaca.  By continuing cranially, the vessels supplying the oviduct and those of the infundibulum are ligated.<br/><br/>* The ovaries are located on the dorsum of the coelomic cavity.   When removing the left ovary, care must be taken not to damage the large renal vein or the left adrenal gland, which is often located between the renal vein and the ovary in the mesovarium.  Anatomically the right ovary is situated very close to the vena cava.  The right adrenal gland is usually found just medial to the vena cava.<br/><br/>* The right ovary is gently exteriorized without damaging the vena cava.<br/><br/>* Apertures are created through the avascular areas of mesovarium, and clips or ligatures are carefully placed around the vessels supplying the ovary.  The tissue between the ligatures and the ovary is transected and the ovary is removed.<br/><br/>* Three vascular clips are visible along the vena cava at the point where the ovary was removed.<br/><br/>* The left ovary is removed in the same manner, taking care not to damage the renal vein.  The left adrenal gland, which usually is located between this vessel and the left ovary, must be identified to avoid being damaged.  Tissues for histopathology and swabs for bacterial cultures should be taken when indicated.  If yolk or purulent material is present in the coelomic cavity, copious irrigation is recommended followed by appropriate use of antibiotics.<br/><br/>* Abdominal closure can be accomplished in one or two layers.  In general, the abdominal musculature and the linea alba do not hold sutures well.<br/><br/>* The primary holding layer is the skin layer.  Nonabsorbable suture material such as nylon or polypropylene should be used.<br/><br/>* The tendency of iguana skin to invert is discouraged with the use of an everting suture pattern such as a horizontal mattress pattern.  This allows the proper apposition of the edges to promote faster healing.  In general it is recommended that sutures be removed in 4 to 6 weeks.<br/><br/>* Oviducts and eggs are removed with the ovaries.","in":"./Clips/IgOIn.mp4","intxt":"* Both pre and post ovulatory egg stasis are common reproductive syndromes in captive female iguanas.  The causes are numerous and often multifactorial.  Lack of proper diet, less than optimal environmental temperatures, handling stress, improper light sources and inadequate nesting sites are some of the common causes of egg stasis in captive iguanas.  Local or systemic disease may also lead to egg stasis.  True gestation time in the common green iguana is difficult to determine but is thought to be 60 to 90 days.  Gravid females will often stop eating for a 3 to 4 week period but they remain active.  A quiet, depressed, gravid female indicates a problem.  Eggs will often be palpable and or visible in the abdomen during this time.<br/><br/>* In cases of confirmed post-ovulatory egg binding, oxytocin at a dose of 1 to 10 units/kg IM may be used in an attempt to stimulate oviposition unless obstruction is present.  Ten percent calcium gluconate at 100 mg/kg IM every 6 hours should be given prior to oxytocin if hypocalcemia is present.  If seizures or tremors are present, calcium gluconate may be given slowly IV prn to effect.  Oxytocin is contraindicated in cases of pre-ovulatory egg stasis.<br/><br/>* Ultraviolet light in the UVB 290 to 320 nanometer range should be provided 12 hours a day.  Nighttime temperatures should not go below 75°F (24°C) and daytime temperatures should be approximately 85°F (29.5°C) with a basking light that heats a limited area to 90 to 95°F (32 to 35°C).<br/><br/>* If the egg stasis fails to respond to correction of environmental or dietary factors, and systemic disease has been addressed, surgery should be considered.","pw":"./Clips/IgOPw.mp4","pwtxt":"* Egg stasis can be pre-ovulatory or post-ovulatory.

The stomach lumen and pylorus are examined for abnormalities.<br/><br/>* The gastrotomy incision is closed using a two-layer inverting suture pattern with 3-0 or 4-0 synthetic absorbable suture material.<br/><br/>* The sutures should incorporate but not penetrate the gastric mucosa.<br/><br/>* Copious amounts of warm saline flush are used to lavage the serosal surface of the stomach without contaminating the abdomen.<br/><br/>* The linea is closed with 3-0 synthetic absorbable sutures in an interrupted pattern.<br/><br/>* Continuous subcutaneous absorbable sutures are placed.<br/><br/>* These are followed with continuous subcuticular sutures.<br/><br/>* Rabbits commonly chew out skin sutures.  Skin staples are effective and generally well tolerated by rabbits if the surgeon prefers this to subcuticular sutures.<br/><br/>* Tissue glue has also been used successfully by some surgeons.","in":"./Clips/LaGaIn.mp4","intxt":"* Subacute to chronic gut stasis is a common syndrome in pet rabbits, often associated with the presence of trichobezoars or “hair balls.”  Rabbits fed a low fiber, high carbohydrate diet are particularly prone to this syndrome.<br/><br/>General clinical signs of hairballs include inappetence, a decrease in size and number of stools, and lethargy; however, these symptoms are also suggestive of numerous other diseases in rabbits.  Dental problems should be ruled out when presented with these clinical signs.  It should be noted that a certain amount of hair in the stomach of rabbits may be normal and will not necessarily cause illness.  Hepatic lipidosis is a common sequela to anorexia in rabbits and may complicate diagnosis and post-surgical recovery.  Cardiomyopathy should also be ruled out before trichobezoar is considered to be the primary problem.  When other diseases are ruled out, medical treatment with parenteral fluids, metoclopramide at 0.2 to 1.0 mg/kg IM, SC, or PO every 8 to 12 hours, syringe feeding with a high fiber, low carbohydrate diet should be tried for several days before surgery is considered.  Gastrotomy for removal of trichobezoars in rabbits should be considered only after medical treatment has been unsuccessful.  Lack of successful medical treatment has often been associated with the inter-operative finding of fibers (carpet fibers, cloth) along with the trichobezoars.  Owners should be given a guarded prognosis until the rabbit begins to eat well again post-surgically.  It may take days to weeks of supportive care before the surgical patient returns to normal.","pw":"./Clips/LaGaPw.mp4","pwtxt":"* A thorough physical exam, complete blood count, complete serum chemistries and radiographs of the thorax and abdomen should precede surgery.<br/><br/>* A large hairball is visible in this rabbit that has not eaten for several days.  These hairballs are often palpable as a large doughy mass in the cranial abdomen.","is":"./Clips/LaGaIs.mp4","istxt":"* No special instrumentation is needed for a rabbit gastrotomy.  A surgical pack devised for a small dog or cat ovariohysterectomy is sufficient.  A 2-0 to 4-0 synthetic absorbable suture material is used.","an":"./Clips/LaGaAn.mp4","antxt":"* In general, rabbits should be fasted for 2 to 4 hours prior to surgery.  Rabbits with a trichobezoar are not eating, therefore fasting will be of minimal concern.  It is not necessary to withhold water.  Prophylactic antibiotics such as enrofloxacin at 5 to 10 mg/kg IM every 12 hours may be started and any pre-existing dehydration should be corrected prior to gastrotomy.<br/><br/>* Acetylpromazine at a dose of 0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg IM or SC can be used as a preanesthetic agent to decrease handling stress.<br/><br/>* Atropine at a dose of 0.8 to 1.0 mg/kg IM or SC may be used as a preanesthetic agent to counteract bradycardia or hypersalivation.  Up to 30% of rabbits produce atropinesterase, which significantly decreases the effectiveness of atropine unless high dosages are used.  Glycopyrrolate can be used as an alternative at a dose of 0.01 to 0.02 mg/kg SC.<br/><br/>* Isoflurane gas is the recommended anesthetic for rabbits.<br/><br/>* This can be administered via a face mask or an anesthetic chamber.<br/><br/>* The rabbit may then be intubated.  The tracheal opening is difficult to visualize due to the rabbit’s oropharyngeal anatomy.  The small mouth opening and thick tongue add to the difficulty in intubation.  Laryngospasm is also common.  For this reason, a face mask is often used to maintain anesthesia in rabbits.<br/><br/>* Most rabbits can be intubated blindly. A finger is used to feel the glottis and guide the tube into the trachea.<br/><br/>* Intubation is preferable to a face mask when possible for gastric surgery.<br/><br/>* When using a face mask, the rabbits head and neck should not be overextended.  Overextension compromises the airway and increases the risk of anesthetic complications.  The mask may be elevated to prevent overextension of the head and neck.  A thorough description of rabbit anesthetics and intubation can be found in the current literature.","pp":"./Clips/LaGaPp.mp4","pptxt":"* Hypothermia is prevented during surgical procedures with a heated table or circulating water blanket.<br/><br/>* The rabbit is placed in dorsal recumbency and the ventral abdomen is clipped from the pubis to slightly cranial to the xiphoid.  Rabbits have delicate skin and thick fur, which make the close clipping required for surgery a challenge.  Keeping the skin flat and tight will help avoid skin tears while clipping.<br/><br/>* The rabbits bladder may be emptied by gentle expression.  To avoid filling the vaginal vestibule with urine, the bladder should not be expressed with the rabbit in dorsal recumbency.<br/><br/>* Chlorhexidine or iodine surgical scrub may be used to prepare the surgical site.<br/><br/>* The skin is gently scrubbed in a routine manner.  Rabbit skin is prone to post-surgical dryness and flaking, which may be exacerbated by iodine sensitivity.","po":"./Clips/LaGaPo.mp4","potxt":"* Body temperature is monitored carefully during surgery and recovery.<br/><br/>* Rabbits that are in a stressful environment and are physically uncomfortable post-surgically are not likely to eat well.  Rabbits that were anorectic prior to surgery will often have pre-existing hepatic lipidosis.  These rabbits must frequently have supportive care for several days before their appetite returns to normal.  Analgesics are highly recommended in rabbits following painful procedures to help prevent anorexia related to the surgery.  Rabbits are particularly prone to post-surgical adhesions.  Studies with verapamil, a calcium channel blocking agent, have shown it to significantly decrease the occurrence of abdominal adhesions post-surgically in rabbits.  Verapamil is used at a dose of 200 µg/kg slowly IV or orally every 8 hours for a total of nine doses.<br/><br/>* Butorphanol at a dose of 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg SC or IM can be used prior to recovery and continued for 1 to 2 days to reduce post-surgical anorexia.<br/><br/>* Recovering rabbits should initially be offered high quality grass hay such as timothy hay post-surgery.  Limited pellets and fresh leafy green vegetables should be added the next day.  Parenteral fluid supplementation and prophylactic antibiotics should be continued as needed.<br/><br/>* Anorectic rabbits should be syringe-fed until they are eating on their own in order to prevent hepatic lipidosis and gut stasis.<br/><br/>* A curved-tip syringe is recommended for syringe-feeding anorectic rabbits.  Soaked pelleted rabbit chow mixed with high fiber, low carbohydrate, vegetable baby food (such as strained mixed green vegetables) may be used for syringe-feeding.  Once recovered, the client should be counseled on proper rabbit diets.  High fiber is essential.  Pellets should be limited or excluded altogether in rabbits that are not growing, gestating or lactating.  Fresh high quality grass hay (not alfalfa) should be fed ad lib along with 1 to 2 cups of fresh clean leafy greens and other low carbohydrate vegetables.  Proper diet will, in many cases, prevent the formation of the pathologic trichobezoar.  Sufficient exercise, regular brushing, and the use of a prophylactic “hair ball” medication will also aid in preventing recurrence.<br/><br/>* Hospitalized rabbits should be provided with their usual diet and protected from stress related to the noise, sight or odor of dogs, cats, snakes, ferrets and other potential predators.","rf":"./Clips/Rf.mp4","rftxt":"1.

In the surgical procedure depicted here, the owner of this affectionate bat had acquired a female of the same species and did not want baby bats to appear.<br/><br/>* The genitalia of male bats is quite pronounced, with a lengthy and easily extruded penis and visible testicles.<br/><br/>* Bats have “thumbs” at the proximal end of the wings, which are necessary for proper climbing and perching.  The thumbs may be seriously damaged if they are pulled from the fabric to which they are clinging.<br/><br/>Bats tolerate isoflurane anesthesia well.  They tend to reach an anesthetic plane quickly, most likely due to their high metabolic rate.<br/><br/>Had this bat been less socialized, a chamber induction would have been recommended.  Although the true incidence of rabies in bats remains a debatable issue, it is wise to not allow anyone to handle a bat who does not have a recently evaluated protective rabies titer.<br/><br/>* The bat is placed in dorsal recumbency and maintained under inhalation anesthesia via a small dog face mask.  Gauze squares or a light towel are inserted around the neck to ensure an adequate delivery of anesthetic gas to the bat rather than to the technician.<br/><br/>As with many small animals, tape is used in lieu of ties to secure the bat’s appendages to the table.<br/><br/>As the technician prepared to clip and surgically scrub the prescrotal area, the penis became engorged and erect.  The height that it attained was quite impressive, as is shown in this photo.<br/><br/>* The penis then began to curl cranially over the area of the intended incision.<br/><br/>* An executive decision was made to secure to penis to the table in a caudal direction to allow access to the surgical site.  Unfortunately, the photograph is not well focused, due to the instability of the camera being held by a person laughing hysterically.<br/><br/>* The remainder of the neuter progressed with no complications, and involved a single prescrotal incision through which each testicle could be exteriorized and removed with a technique identical to that used in a small dog.  A short subcuticular pattern of 5-0 absorbable suture was used to close the subcutis and skin.<br/><br/>* Recovery was uneventful.  From the look on his face, (the focus problem in this photo was a mutual situation) it is doubtful that the bat will ever be &ldquo;eventful&rdquo; again."},"squirrel orchiectomy precautions (brief)":{"pr":"./Clips/MxSqNu.mp4","prtxt":"* Adult sexually active male squirrels have very pronounced and accessible testes.  Orchiectomy can be performed either pre-scrotally or with an incision over each testicle.<br/><br/>The demand in private practice for castration of squirrels is minimal.  However, injuries severe enough to preclude rehabilitation and release do occur, and some individuals will keep these animals as pets.  The tendency toward hyperexcitability and inappropriate urination seems to diminish following castration.<br/><br/>* One of the variables encountered in this procedure is the presence of two round, firm structures where one would expect anal sacs to be located.  These were encountered and explored following the completion of the orchiectomy.  Attempts to express these structures resulted in no discharge or release of pressure.  Assuming that they may be impacted anal glands, the area on the right side was scrubbed and incised over the structure.  The appearance of the underlying tissue was very firm, tubular and convoluted.  When manipulated, it caused the penis to retract caudally.  Because the potential existed for disrupted vasculature or damage to the secretory pathway of this organ due to the incision, the structure was removed (after passing a urinary catheter to ensure that the urethra was not included in the resection).  Assuming that the structure was actually an accessory sex gland, the contralateral one was left intact.<br/><br/>At recheck (in about 6 weeks), there was no visible difference between the two sides of the scrotum.  No difficulty with urination was noted by the owner.  No blood was observed in the urine.  The squirrels activity and appetite had returned to normal.  In fact, his weight had increased slightly, and his urination behavior on the owner had decreased, as had the strong odor of the urine.  Although fairly tame, a visual inspection was all that the squirrel would allow, and the owner declined inhalant anesthesia for palpation due to the excellent condition of his pet."},"sugar glider orchiectomy (brief)":{"pr":"./Clips/MxSGOr.mp4","prtxt":"* Sugar gliders possess a gliding membrane that extends from the lateral front leg to the tarsus, and allows them to glide long distances.  Therefore, they require a very large cage relative to their size in order to facilitate climbing and gliding.  Being social animals, they do best when kept in pairs or in larger related groups, although fights may occur among unrelated animals in defense of their nesting area.  They are frightened by exposure to bright light.  A dark, semi-enclosed hiding area for use during the day is necessary for their sense of security.<br/><br/>* Males can be identified by the dark “bald” patch on the top of the head that develops with maturity, and a similar patch that appears on the upper chest.  These structures are musk glands, used by the male to scent-mark territory and females.<br/><br/>* Being marsupials, the young are born in an embryonic state and migrate to the mother’s pouch for further development.  Litters usually consist of one to two offspring.  Once the young begin leaving the pouch for brief periods, many breeders will bottle-feed these babies in order to acclimate them to human contact.<br/><br/>* In nature, these animals are reported to be mainly insectivorous, also consuming the sap from trees and some fruit juices when available.  At a minimum, an adequate captive diet should include gut-loaded insects, a good, balanced source of animal protein, fruits, and nectars.  For more details on successful captive diets for this marsupial, please refer to the current literature.<br/><br/>* Weighing only 100 to 150 grams, and being particularly stressed by handling by strangers and in bright light, most preoperative work-ups carry more inherent danger than benefit.  The sugar glider is routinely masked down with isoflurane in a dark, quiet room using a chamber or a dog face mask.<br/><br/>* When sufficient relaxation has occurred, a complete physical examination can be performed.  If there is reason to suspect anemia or infection, blood may be drawn from the tail, cephalic or jugular vein.<br/><br/>* An unusual anatomical difference between sugar gliders and most mammals is that the testes are contained in a pendulous scrotal sac that is considerably cranial to the penis, near the umbilicus.  The two circular, prominent anal sacs adjacent to the penis may be mistaken for testes and cause the individual to be misidentified as a male, when it is actually a female.  The scrotum, once its location is known, is very pronounced.<br/><br/>* Surgery proceeds as it would for any other simple castration.  The testes are readily accessible through a scrotal incision, either a single incision, or one over each testicle.  Due to the pendulous nature of the scrotum, the clinician may elect to ablate this at the same time.<br/><br/>* When both testicles have been removed, the scrotal skin can be closed with a single subcuticular suture or a drop of tissue glue.<br/><br/>* The relative position of the scrotum and the penis are noted here.<br/><br/>* Recovery is generally uneventful, and the glider returns to eating and normal activity the night following surgery.<br/><br/>Reference:<br/><br/>1.

EXOTIC DVM, Premiere: 4, 1998."},"rabit and rodent dental techniques (brief)":{"pr":"./Clips/MxRoDen.mp4","prtxt":"* Both the incisors and the molars of rabbits and rodents are open-rooted.  This means they grow continuously throughout the life of the animal.<br/><br/>* Malocclusion of the incisors is a common medical presentation.  This malocclusion may be primary or secondary to molar malocclusion.<br/><br/>* The reasons for primary incisor malocclusion include; congenital (especially in dwarf breed rabbits), traumatic, infectious, and advanced age.<br/><br/>* Most primary incisor malocclusion is congenital and will therefore present to the veterinarian while the animal is still young.<br/><br/>* These pets will be in need of repeated incisor trimming throughout their lives.  The option to this is incisor extraction.  The technique for this procedure is described in the literature.<br/><br/>* Secondary incisor malocclusion is more common and its presence is often not obvious.  These animals present for anorexia with incisor overgrowth.  The owners may request “Just a tooth trim”.  If the incisors are trimmed, without molar malocclusion being diagnosed and treated, these animals will not return to normal appetite or attitude.<br/><br/>* Every rabbit and rodent that is presented for a physical examination should have an oral examination.<br/><br/>* The oral cavity is extremely small and visualization is difficult, especially in the chinchilla and guinea pig.<br/><br/>* Some animals are too fractious or the procedure is too painful to allow an oral examination while awake.  These species tolerate isoflurane well.  If one is comfortable with this anesthetic but not experienced with restraint, it may be wise to anesthetize the animal rather than struggle with a fractious patient.<br/><br/>* By inserting the index finger between the buccal mucosa and the molars, one can often palpate sharp edges without visualization.<br/><br/>* Admittedly, the pet will not appreciate this procedure, and it should be done quickly (and possibly only by the dim-witted).<br/><br/>* Equipment that may be utilized for visualization and trimming of the molars includes:<br/>1) An otoscope with a regular large plastic cone attached.<br/>2) A special modified metal speculum for the otoscope head.<br/>3) A pediatric nasal speculum.<br/>4) A pediatric laryngoscope, which contains a bright light source at the tip, is constructed of metal, and has a single blade that allows maneuvering to retract buccal mucosa while visualizing the molars.<br/>5) Ronguers.<br/>6) Dremel® sander (only useful in the larger rabbits).<br/>7) Dental drills or drill adapters for Dremel®  tools.<br/>Ronguers or a dental drill is generally used for the bulk of the molar trimming.  Some adaptations of dental drills also work well to smooth the edges of the molars.<br/><br/>Care must be taken with dental drills to avoid soft tissue trauma and overheating.  In the absence of the appropriate dental equipment, trimming with Ronguers, followed if needed by filing<br/><br/>* with a steel V-shaped bird nail file, will generally suffice.<br/><br/>* Sedatives, analgesics, and anesthetics that may be utilized for either the molar trimming procedure or for post-trimming discomfort include:<br/>1) Butorphanol tartrate at 0.05 to 0.5 mg/kg IV, SC, or IM every 4 to 6 hours.  This medication has only a minimal sedative effect and is most useful when the patient is complacent, but pain is evident on examination due to oral ulceration.  It can be repeated as dosed above after completion of the molar trim to allow more rapid return to eating.<br/>2) Ketamine hydrochloride at 15 to 25 mg/kg IM.<br/>3) Isoflurane alone or following one of the above medications.  When used alone, there will be limited time to work in the mouth after the face mask delivering the isoflurane is removed.  Intubation is ideal, and generally can be accomplished in most medium to large rabbits.<br/><br/>* If underlying oral disease is suspected, radiographs may be helpful.  Oral neoplasia is common in prairie dogs.<br/><br/>* Oral infections, including tooth root abscessation, mandibular osteomyelitis and soft tissue abscesses, are common in rabbits.  Rabbits with oral ulceration or abscessation in conjunction with molar overgrowth should receive aggressive diagnostics and treatment.  The potential for Pasteurellosis should be strongly considered.  If antibiotics are warranted, bear in mind the intolerance of rabbits and herbivorous rodents for oral administration of narrow spectrum medications that are active against gram-positive bacteria.<br/><br/>* Regardless of the species or concurrent oral disease conditions, syringe-feeding may be necessary until the animal regains a normal appetite.<br/><br/>* Molar malocclusion must be detected before it can be treated.  As with most syndromes in any species, quality veterinary care begins with a thorough history and physical examination."}}}');
