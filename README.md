======================
The github repo does not have all the video files. Only the videos for the first proceedure.

Current web app version: www.avianandanimal.com/test

Tasks needed:
1. Create new graphics for the “home” image (including new name?)
2. Create new graphics for the “about” image
3. Create new icons for the menus
4. Possibly update look and feel of UI to match new art
5. Create a iPhone version of the UI that has a initial selection menus (Species, Procedure, Section, About) to launch the videos.  The text on the iPad version will not be displayed on the iPhone version.  The iPhone version will only allow the videos to be played (in full screen) based on the user selection of a menu system.
6. Encapsulate in Cordova/Phonegap for iPad and iPhone devices (later may add Surface and Android)
7. Get on App store

Future enhancements:
A. On iPad version, make the text sync up to the voice.

Q&A:
1.	Do you currently have all the videos ready?  Yes I have all the videos... I will probably re-compress them for the final as they are currently not at the correct resolution, but the names and locations should stay the same.
2.	Would the app be landscape layout only? Yes the app would be landscape only on any device
3.	For new graphics, would you want a round of compositions first to choose a style? Probably yes... unless the first one was awesome -).
4.	Are you currently signed up with the iOS Developer Program so we can publish the apps? Yes I have a Apple Developer ID... have not used it ever so not sure if it is working.
