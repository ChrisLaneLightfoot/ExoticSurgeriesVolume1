======================
The github repo does not have all the video files. Only the video for the first proceedure.

Current web app version: www.avianandanimal.com/test

Tasks needed:
1. Create new graphics for the “home” image (including new name?)
2. Create new graphics for the “about” image
3. Create new icons for the menus
4. Possibly update look and feel of UI to match new art
5. Create a iPhone version of the UI that has a initial selection menus (Species, Procedure, Section, About) to launch the videos.  The text on the iPad version will not be displayed on the iPhone version.  The iPhone version will only allow the videos to be played (in full screen) based on the user selection of a menu system.
6. Encapsulate in Cordova/Phonegap for iPad and iPhone devices (later may add Surface and Android)
7. Get on App store

Future enhancements.
A. On iPad version, make the text sync up to the voice.
